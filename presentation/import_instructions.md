# n8n Workflow Import Instructions
## Quick Setup for RAG Demo

### **Import All Workflows (5 minutes)**

1. **Start n8n:**
```bash
cd ~/n8n
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:5678
```

2. **Import Workflows:**
- In n8n interface, click **"+ New"** â†’ **"Import from File"**
- Import in this order:
  1. `naive_rag_workflow.json` - Basic RAG system
  2. `hybrid_rag_workflow.json` - Hybrid with parameter control  
  3. `adaptive_rag_workflow.json` - Intelligent query routing
  4. `comparison_workflow.json` - Side-by-side comparison

3. **Verify API Connection:**
- Test endpoint: `curl http://host.docker.internal:8000/health`
- If fails, check Docker networking or use your actual host IP

### **Pre-Demo Test Sequence (5 minutes)**

1. **Test Naive RAG:**
   - Open "Naive RAG Demo" workflow
   - Click "Execute Workflow"
   - Verify green checkmarks and JSON response

2. **Test Hybrid RAG:**
   - Open "Hybrid RAG Demo" workflow  
   - Try different alpha values: 0.3, 0.5, 0.7
   - Verify different context results

3. **Test Adaptive RAG:**
   - Open "Adaptive RAG Demo" workflow
   - Try different queries in "Query Selection" node:
     - Factual: "What is WAL in PostgreSQL?"
     - Conceptual: "How does MVCC work?"
     - Procedural: "Steps to configure replication"

4. **Test Comparison Dashboard:**
   - Open "RAG Method Comparison Dashboard"
   - Execute and verify all three methods run
   - Check winner analysis

### **Demo Day Checklist**

**Technical Setup:**
- [ ] PostgreSQL with pgvector running
- [ ] All lab APIs responding (port 8000)
- [ ] n8n accessible (port 5678)  
- [ ] All 4 workflows imported and tested
- [ ] OpenAI API key working
- [ ] Network connectivity verified

**Backup Plans:**
- [ ] Secondary laptop with identical setup
- [ ] Pre-recorded screencast (5 min version)
- [ ] Mobile hotspot ready
- [ ] API endpoint documentation printed

**Presentation Materials:**
- [ ] Clicker/remote tested
- [ ] Screen sharing configured  
- [ ] Presentation timing practiced
- [ ] Q&A answers prepared

### **Workflow Descriptions for Audience**

**Naive RAG Demo:**
- Single dense embedding search
- Basic vector similarity with pgvector
- Good baseline but limited exact term matching

**Hybrid RAG with Controls:**  
- Combines dense + sparse embeddings
- Interactive alpha parameter tuning
- Shows real-time impact of weight changes
- Visual feedback on context differences

**Adaptive RAG with Intelligence:**
- Automatic query type classification
- Smart routing to optimal search strategy
- Demonstrates 15-20% improvement over static methods
- Shows system learning and adaptation

**Comparison Dashboard:**
- All three methods tested simultaneously  
- Performance metrics (speed, quality)
- Winner analysis with reasoning
- Production-ready evaluation framework

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"Connection refused" errors:**
```bash
# Check if APIs are running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# If using Docker, try host IP instead
curl http://192.168.1.100:8000/health
```

**Slow API responses:**
- Check PostgreSQL connections
- Verify OpenAI API limits
- Monitor system resources

**n8n workflow errors:**
- Restart n8n container: `docker-compose restart`
- Clear browser cache
- Re-import workflows if corrupted

**Demo timing issues:**
- Skip adaptive section if running behind
- Use comparison workflow for quick results
- Pre-execute workflows for guaranteed results

### **Audience Interaction Points**

**During Naive RAG:**
- "Can everyone see the JSON response clearly?"
- "Notice the response time - about 200ms"

**During Hybrid Tuning:**
- "Who thinks alpha=0.3 gave better results?" [show of hands]
- "Let's try 0.7 - watch how contexts change"

**During Adaptive Demo:**
- "What type of query should we test next?"
- "Notice how the system adapts automatically"

**During Comparison:**
- "Any predictions on which method will win?"
- "Look at these performance differences"

### **Success Metrics**

**Technical Success:**
- All workflows execute without errors
- Clear performance differences shown
- Real-time parameter tuning works
- Audience can follow the data flow

**Message Delivery:**
- Hybrid approach clearly outperforms single methods
- n8n useful for prototyping, APIs for production
- PostgreSQL competitive with specialized vector DBs
- DBAs essential for production AI systems

Remember: The goal is to show practical, production-ready RAG systems, not just demos. Every workflow should reinforce the message that hybrid search consistently outperforms single methods while PostgreSQL provides enterprise-grade vector capabilities.
